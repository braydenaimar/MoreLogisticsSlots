Created by Wenihal (http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5761) - whom I don't know,
but since he stoped updating the mod, I took it upon myself to import it into github for the convinience of the community.

 Version 1.0.1 - updated to confirm with #Factorio 0.12.7 (adding the 5th row) by narc0tiq
